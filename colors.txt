Several people have expressed confusion about what color codes to use in
ndir.ini, since I don't support symbolic names.  Apparently the once-
common knowledge of the DOS color mapping is becoming a lost art!!

To aid people in choosing colors in ndir.ini, I am including the
colors.exe utility.  It will display the first 128 DOS colors
on the console.  The four-digit number, beginning with 0x , is the
value that you can enter in the INI file.

This utility, like everything in this package, is freeware.
